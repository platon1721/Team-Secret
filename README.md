	<h1>Team Secret</h1>
	<p>Team Secret is a European professional Dota 2 team.</p>
	<h2>Historyof Formation</h2>
	<p>After Natus Vincere and Fnatic both underperformed at The International 2014, two key members of the two organizations, Kuroky and N0tail, respectively, had an idea for a team that was run by the players, not beholden to any esports organization. Kuroky brought on his friend and teammate on Na'Vi, Puppey, while N0tail brought on his friend and teammate, Fly. They rounded out their roster with Alliance midlaner s4, whose team similarly underperformed at TI4. The roster made their public debut in the qualifiers for Star Ladder Star Series Season 10.
